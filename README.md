The Brick Breaker is a classic game where you must select 2 or more color matched bricks to be removed from the screen.
There is also the option to choose the black brick, which is a bomb brick and destroys all the neighbouring bricks that are close to it with max distance of 1.

The game is written in Java as a personal project to test my coding skills in my early stages of learning.
